    <h1>Student's Role- The Future Heros</h1>
    <p>
        As an individual, there are many ways you can contribute to solving global warming. Here are a few suggestions:

        1. Reduce your carbon footprint: This can be done by making small changes in your daily life such as using public transportation, cycling or walking instead of driving, turning off lights and appliances when not in use, and reducing water usage.

        2. Use energy-efficient products: Replace old appliances, light bulbs, and electronics with energy-efficient ones. This will not only reduce your energy bills but also reduce your carbon footprint.

        3. Plant trees: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen. Planting trees in your home or community can help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.

        4. Support renewable energy: You can support renewable energy by investing in solar panels or wind turbines. You can also opt for energy suppliers that use renewable sources of energy.

        5. Spread awareness: Educate others about global warming and its impact on the planet. Encourage people to take action and join efforts to combat climate change.

        Remember, every small action counts. By making conscious choices and changes in our daily lives, we can collectively make a big difference in solving global warming.
