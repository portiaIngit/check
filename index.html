    <p>Global warming is the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun, causing the planet's temperature to rise and leading to a wide range of environmental and societal impacts.

        Some of the effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, as well as more intense tropical storms and hurricanes. These changes threaten ecosystems, food supplies, and human health and well-being.
        
        To combat global warming, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a combination of measures such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable land use practices. Additionally, individuals can take actions such as reducing their carbon footprint by cutting down on energy consumption, driving less, and eating a plant-based diet.
