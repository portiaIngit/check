    <h1>Helper</h1>
    <p>
        As helpers, we can contribute to solving global warming by taking small but meaningful steps in our daily lives. Here are some ways we can help:

        1. Reduce energy consumption: We can conserve energy by turning off lights and appliances when not in use, using energy-saving light bulbs, and keeping our homes properly insulated.

        2. Use public transport: We can reduce our carbon footprint by using public transport or carpooling instead of driving alone. We can also walk or bike to nearby destinations if possible.

        3. Adopt a plant-based diet: Eating less meat and dairy products can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We can also opt for sustainably sourced food products.

        4. Support renewable energy: We can support the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower by advocating for their adoption and investing in them.

        5. Collaborate with others: We can collaborate with other individuals, schools, and organizations to share ideas and resources on addressing global warming and promoting sustainability. Together, we can make a bigger impact in mitigating the effects of global warming.

        By taking these steps, we can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable planet for ourselves and future generations.
